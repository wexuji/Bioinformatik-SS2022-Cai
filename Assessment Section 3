data(heights)
options(digits = 3)

#First, determine the average height in this dataset. 
#Then create a logical vector ind with the indices for those individuals who are 
#above average height.

#How many individuals in the dataset are above average height?
str(heights)
avg <- mean(heights$height)

ind <- sort(heights$height > avg)
sum(ind)

#How many individuals in the dataset are above average height and are female?
sex_ind <- sort(heights$sex == "Female")
ab_avg_f <- sum(ind & sex_ind)
sum(ab_avg_f)
filter(heights, sex == "Female" & height > avg)
#31 individuals are above avg height female

#What proportion of individuals in the dataset are female?
#total count of entries: 1050 
female <- sort(heights$sex == "Female")
female_total <- sum(female)
female_proportion <- female_total/1050
print(female_proportion)
#correct answer: using mean() on female subset
#mean(heights$sex == "Female")

#Question4
#Determine the minimum height in the heights dataset.
min_height <- min(heights$height)

#Use the match() function to determine the index of the first individual with the 
#minimum height.
help(match)
match(min_height, heights$height)
#answer: 1032

#Subset the sex column of the dataset by the index in 4b to determine the 
#individualâ€™s sex.
heights$sex[1032]
#ans: Male

#Question 5
#Question 5a: Determine the maximum height
max_height <- max(heights$height)
print(max_height)
#ans: 82.7

#Which integer values are between the maximum and minimum heights? For example, 
#if the minimum height is 10.2 and the maximum height is 20.8, your answer should
#be x <- 11:20 to capture the integers in between those values. (If either 
#the maximum or minimum height are integers, include those values too.)

#Write code to create a vector x that includes the integers between the minimum 
#and maximum heights in this dataset (as numbers).

x <- heights$height %in% 49:83
sum(!x)


#Question 6 
#Using the heights dataset, create a new column of heights in centimeters named 
#ht_cm. Recall that 1 inch = 2.54 centimeters. Save the resulting dataset as 
#heights2.

ht_cm <- heights$height*2.54 
heights2 <- mutate(heights, ht_cm = ht_cm)
heights2$ht_cm[18]

#What is the mean height in centimeters?
mean(heights2$ht_cm)

#Create a data frame females by filtering the heights2 data to contain only female
#individuals.
female <- filter(heights2, sex == "Female")
head(female)

#How many females are in the heights2 dataset?
str(female)
#nrow(females)

#mean height of females in cm 
mean(female$ht_cm)

#Question 8 
#The olive dataset in dslabs contains composition in percentage of eight fatty 
#acids found in the lipid fraction of 572 Italian olive oils:
data(olive)
head(olive)

#Plot the percent palmitic acid versus palmitoleic acid in a scatterplot. 
#What relationship do you see?

plot(olive$palmitic, olive$palmitoleic)
#ans: positive linear relationship

#Question 9 
#Create a histogram of the percentage of eicosenoic acid in olive.
#Which of the following is true? 
hist(olive$eicosenoic)
#The most common value of eicosenoic acid is below 0.05%

#Question 10 
#Make a boxplot of palmitic acid percentage in olive with separate distr. for 
#each region
#Which region has the highest median palmitic acid percentage? 
boxplot(palmitic~region, data = olive)
help(boxplot)
